## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is My Own Games LIbrary or mogli for short. This Project exists to make a netflix like library from your game installer folder. We started this project because we wanted to be able to host our own games library on a home server, like it is possible with other collections. Since there is no such tool available at the moment, we decided to build it ourselves.
