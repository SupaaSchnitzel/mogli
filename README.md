## 🧐 About

"<b>M</b>y <b>O</b>wn <b>G</b>ame-<b>LI</b>brary" (mogli) is a self-hosted tool for managing your own library of DRM-free game installers. We started this project because we wanted to be able to host our own games library on a home server, like it is possible with other collections. Since there is no such tool available at the moment, we decided to build it ourselves.
